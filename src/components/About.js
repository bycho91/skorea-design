          <strong>South Korea</strong> is an extraordinary country filled with
          beautiful beaches, thriving cities, ancient temples, remarkable
          natural scenery and most importantly, friendly people. South Korea has
          come a long way since The Korean War ended in 1953. Almost all of
          South Korea was completely leveled during the war which is hard to
          imagine if you have seen Korea recently.
